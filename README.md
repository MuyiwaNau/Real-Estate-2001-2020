Here's a short description of the dataset:

- Serial Number: Is just a unique set of digits to identify each transaction

- List year: This is the year that the particular property was put up for sale.

- Date Recorded: Is the date that the transaction was completed. That is, the year the property was bought.

- Town: The town where this property is located.

- Address: The property's address.

- Assessed Value: How much the property is generally considered to be worth.

- Sale Amount: How much the property was actually sold for.

- Sales Ratio: The ratio measures how close the selling price of the property is to it's assessed value.

- Property Type: What kind of property it is.

- Residential Type: If it is a residential property, what type is it.

- Years until sold: Number of years before the property was finally sold

This dataset can be used for analysis and even machine learning projects. For those doing analysis, I invite you to try and answer these questions:

Average assessed value of properties from year to year?
- Average sale amount of properties from year to year?
- Average sales ratio of properties from year to year?
- How long, on average, did it take for the different property types to get sold?
- How long, on average, did it take for the different residential types to get sold?
- Which towns saw the most property sales in 2021?
- For those more interested in using this dataset in machine learning projects to forecast future property prices, I invite you also. Let's learn from your work.
